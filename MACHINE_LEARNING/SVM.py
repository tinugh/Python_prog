SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE(SVM):
#supervised machne learning algorithm
#used for classification
#majority used for image classification

#linearly seperable line:seperating the data into two different using a line
#multiple lines can be drawn but linearly sepearable line should be max distance from both category
#linearly seperable line is enclosed with a plane called "hyperplane"
#the points that are touched by the hyperplane they are called support vector
#nyperplane is high margined
